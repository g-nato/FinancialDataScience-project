## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply various machine learning models to a dataset containing financial indicators of Italian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The primary objective is to evaluate which model performs best in predicting business defaults.

This project also explores the impact of adding centrality measures, derived from network analysis, and clusters obtained through cluster analysis as additional explanatory variables. The aim is to determine whether incorporating these features improves the model's predictive performance regarding company defaults.
